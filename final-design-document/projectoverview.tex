\section{Project Overview}

\subsection{Technical Objectives}

\subsubsection{Batterylife}

The device will be able to remain opperational for six hours disconnected to any
given power supply. This will allow the user to change location and find a place
of inspiration before composing a musical piece

\subsubsection{Energy Consumption}

The device will consume no more than 12 watts in a given moment. This will allow
for an extended battery life to longer times and mitigate the environmental
impact of the MIDI controller

\subsubsection{Processing Time}

The time it takes to compute a given function will take no longer than 5
seconds, limiting user frustration upon percieved lag. This will also force an
efficient solution to the Energy consumption problem as the longer the device
uses the main computing unit the more power it will consume.

\subsection{Goals}

\subsubsection{Function of the Project}

The final product of this project should serve as a music production and music
education tool. The keyboard itself will allow the user to interactively experiment with
writing melodies, and the autofill feature will assist in expanding the user’s capability.
For music production it can kickstart the writing process, allowing a smooth and
constant flow of ideas and creativity, thereby boosting the productivity of the user.
For music education it can, through demonstration, teach stylistic patterns and
structures that the user can mimic in their own writing to create a similar sound.

\subsubsection{DAW Integrated Keyboard}

Create a MIDI controller with an integrated and complete Digitial Audio
Workstation(DAW) in the system. The DAW will be able to interact with the user
via the keyboard, which acts as the MIDI controller, and can export a completed
MIDI file to a third party computer.

\subsubsection{Quantization}

The DAW will be able to Quantize a user recording to best fit the percieved
tempo of the recording being played. Users will also be able to adjust said
recording to find the perfect locaiton for each not

\subsubsection{Auto Fill}

The device will be able to fill in a melody to help the user create a unique
piece of music that falls into a specific genre selected.

\subsubsection{Auto Correct}

The device will be able to offer suggestions on a given piece to improve it to
better fit the genre selected.

\subsubsection{Education Mode}

The device will be able to help in the teaching of newer users or muscicians to
master the art of composition and playing melodies.

\subsubsection{Design Criteria}

Aside from achieving base functionality, there are few requirements regarding the
product’s design. Its keys should be aesthetically and structurally reminiscent of a
piano, to make for more intuitive use. Additionally, the visualization of the melody in
the DAW should follow the horizontal bar format seen in most standard MIDI editors.

\subsubsection{Constraints}

The primary constraint of this project will be hardware. Both the AI model and Digital
Audio Workstation will need to be operating without the assistance of external
processing power. Additionally, we hope to make this product affordable. To meet
these needs, we will need to strike a balance between the complexity of the software
and the capabilities of decently priced hardware.
